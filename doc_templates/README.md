# Download Readme Template

The download_readme_template file is copied and used as a template for the documentation included in the zip files created by the download structures API:
*api/download_structures.

The 'Snapshot Details' section is updated to include the following information:
 
- The Download URL
- The API parameters used
- A list of the files in the zip file.

The file will then be turned into a PDF before being added to the zip file.
